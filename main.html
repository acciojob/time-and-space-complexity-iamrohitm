	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a way to measure how the running time of an algorithm increases as the input size grows. 
        An algorithm with good Time complexity is considered more efficient because it performs its operations faster 
        even as the data size increases.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. 
        Space Complexity is often expressed using Big-O notation, such as O(n), which describes how the memory 
        requirements grow as the input becomes larger.
